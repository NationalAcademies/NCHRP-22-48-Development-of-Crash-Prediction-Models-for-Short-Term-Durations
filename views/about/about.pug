        p This tool was developed under the NCHRP 22-48 project. The tool aims to provide an easy way to use the developed short-term crash prediction models for different use case scenarios. The tool should be utilized along with the Projectâ€™s user guide. The user guide includes the following:
        ul
            li The required data variables
            li The detailed steps to process microscopic raw data
            li The developed short-term crash prediction models for different use case scenarios and crash severity levels including:
                ul
                    li KABCO : Five-level injury severity scale, K = fatal injury; A = incapacitating injury; B = non-incapacitating evident injury; C = possible injury; O = property damage only
                    li KABC : Fatal and injury crashes
                    li KAB : Fatal and visible injury crashes
                    li KA : Fatal and severe injury crashes
                    li O : Property damage only crashes

        p The project was conducted under the lead of University of Central Florida Smart & Safe Transportation Lab and the contribution of University of Connecticut.
